Hello,

Please find my installation instructions and how-to’s on Git, GitHub, and WebStorm.

Git is installed locally to save versions of your code and commit, push, or pull files.  
You can find installation instructions for Git here:  
https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac

GitHub is a web based platform where you can create and host repositories for your projects (codes/files)
You can create a GitHub account here:  
https://github.com/signup

WebStorm is a development platform where you can write your code, use Git features directly from the platform, and link your GitHub repositories.  
You can download WebStorm here:  
https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=mac
*(You can also use your student account to sign up for JetBrains tools.)*


Installation:

1. Install Git on your computer. I’m using a Mac. On macOS, open your Terminal:
    - If you don’t have Homebrew, install it by typing:
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
    - Then install Git by typing:
           brew install git

2. Download WebStorm from the link above. If you’d like, you can also apply for a free student license.
3. Once your WebStorm environment is set up, sign up for GitHub and create a repository for your code/files.
4. After your repository is created, link or “clone” it to WebStorm so you have a local copy of your repository.
5. In WebStorm, once you have cloned your repository, you can edit it and use Git features like Commit, Push, or Pull directly from inside WebStorm.
6. When done, click Git → Commit to save that version of your file and write a message describing what you did in that commit.
7. Once committed, you can Push your changes to GitHub by clicking Git → Push and confirming where you are pushing your project.
8. Once pushed, the updates to your project will appear on GitHub.

**Commit** = Saves a version of your file.

**Fetch** = Retrieves updates from the most recent commits in the repository without merging.

**GIT** = Version control

**Github** = Web-based platform where you can create online repositories.

**Merge** = Merging branches (e.g., merging a test branch into the main branch)

**Merge Conflict** = An issue when merging branches

**Push** = Upload commits to the repository

**Pull** = Retrieves updates from the most recent commits and merges them automatically.

**Remote** = Your online repository on GitHub

**Repository** = A storage space where you can keep your project files and commits.
